# React Form Components

This document contains two React components demonstrating form validation and dynamic input handling using `useRef` and hooks.

## 1. FormValidation Component

### Learnings

- **Input Validation**: The component demonstrates how to validate form inputs in real-time using the `useRef` hook to access input values directly.
- **Error Handling**: The component uses a state variable (`error`) to manage and display validation messages dynamically.
- **Data Management**: The component collects form data and displays it after submission, showcasing state management with the `useState` hook.

## 2. DynamicForm Component

### Learnings

- **Dynamic Inputs**: This component creates multiple input fields dynamically, demonstrating how to use arrays in React for rendering components.
- **Ref Handling**: The component uses `useRef` to manage multiple input references, allowing for focused manipulation of specific fields.
- **Focus Management**: The ability to focus on specific inputs using a button showcases user interaction and improves user experience.

## Conclusion

These components provide practical examples of how to handle forms in React with input validation and dynamic rendering, utilizing hooks such as `useRef` and `useState`.

This project is a simple, customizable OTP (One Time Password) input component built using React. The component allows users to input and paste a 6-digit OTP, with built-in features for navigation, validation, and submission.

## Features

- **Single-digit input fields**: Each box accepts one digit.
- **Auto-focus**: Moves to the next input box automatically when a digit is entered.
- **Backspace navigation**: Moves to the previous box when backspace is pressed.
- **Paste support**: Users can paste the entire OTP, and it will fill the input boxes correctly.
- **Form validation**: Submit button is disabled until all input boxes are filled with valid digits.
- **OTP submission**: Upon form submission, the OTP is displayed in an alert and logged to the console.
